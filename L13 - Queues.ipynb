    "\n",
    "A queue is a collection in which the elements are maintained in the same order in which they were added. A linear collection is the simplest kind and can be implemented as a singly-linked-list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, we make a queue as a **f**irst-**in**-**f**irst-**o**ut, or **FIFO**.\n",

    "### Enqueue\n",
    "* add a new element to the *back* of the queue\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dequeue\n",
    "* remove an element from the *front* of the queue\n",
    "* return the value of the element\n",
    "\n",
    "We have some design options for implementing the queue structure. Consider:\n",
    "* functional requirements\n",
    "    * actually doing the job\n",
    "* non-functional requirements\n",
    "    * execution speed\n",
    "    * memory footprint\n",
